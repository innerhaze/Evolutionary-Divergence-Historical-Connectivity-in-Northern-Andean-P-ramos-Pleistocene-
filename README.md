# Evolutionary-Divergence-Historical-Connectivity-in-Northern-Andean-P-ramos-Pleistocene-
The Andean p√°ramos' biodiversity and adaptations were shaped by Pleistocene climate fluctuations. We used a custom algorithm and a paleoclimatic model to calculate historical connectivity, linking it to genetic divergence in a Generalized Dissimilarity Model (GDM).

# **Introduction**

The Andean páramos, recognized for their unique biodiversity and specific adaptations to high mountain conditions, have been shaped by geological and climatic events, particularly during the Pleistocene. This period was characterized by recurrent climate fluctuations associated with Earth's orbit around the sun, which led to the expansion and contraction of páramo environments, generating a complex connectivity history (Figure 1, 2). To investigate how these climatic fluctuations may have influenced the diversification of páramo-associated organisms, we employed an algorithm specifically developed to calculate historical connectivity based on a paleoclimatic model describing the altitudinal extent of the páramo and its duration during the Pleistocene. We used these connectivity estimates as predictors of genetic divergence in a Generalized Dissimilarity Model (GDM) to establish a link between diversification resulting from continuous fragmentation during glacial cycles.

To carry out the complete process of relating historical connectivity with evolutionary distances of páramo organisms, the following provides a detailed process is outlined below, including direct links to each step and its corresponding GitHub repository. This material facilitates the reconstruction of the procedure and is applicable to both the raw evolutionary distance data of the Espeletine subtribe used in the original study and other groups with ecosystems in the northern Andean páramos, whose phylogeny is an ultrametric tree with divergence times not exceeding 2.2 million years between groups. This is because the paleoclimatic model by Flantua et al. (2019) covers up to that age.
